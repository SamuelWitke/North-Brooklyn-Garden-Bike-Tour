      We caught glimpses of faces at most of the windows peering curiously at us
      and watching our progress through the town.

      Much to our surprise, when about two miles outside Reykjavik, we met our
      fellow-passenger by the Ceres, him with whom we had lunched at Thorshavn
      on the outward journey. We had left him behind at that port, and he had
      intended to stay for several weeks at the Faroes and to return thence to
      England; but having found things rather slow there, he had followed us to
      Iceland by the next steamer; hence the meeting on the road.

      We created some sort of sensation as we entered the capital of Iceland.
      The clocks were striking ten as we clattered down the long main street; it
      was a time when the populace were at leisure and on the street, and they
      evinced no little curiosity as we rode by them. They were congregated in
      small groups, and it was evident to us that we were being discussed—and no
      wonder, for we were a motley-looking cavalcade! We must have presented a
      very grotesque appearance, clad as we were in oilskins, and covered with
      mud from head to foot: it had been raining at intervals on the way, and we
      had had a rather disagreeable journey.{" "}

      We caught glimpses of faces at most of the windows peering curiously at us
      and watching our progress through the town. Many of the members of the
      groups, by the wayside saluted as we passed by—the Icelanders are a polite
      people, as a rule, and they doff their head-gear in salutation to
      strangers. So we progressed, being saluted, and acknowledging the salutes.
      It was a sort of triumphal entry, for the news had been carried forward by
      one of the guides, who was some little distance ahead with some of the
      pack-ponies, that we had just crossed the country by way of the
      uninhabited interior. All things come to an end, and so did our journey
      when we reached the end of the main street in Reykjavik, for there, at a
      great wooden building four stories high, we took up our quarters, and the
      crossing of Iceland was an accomplished fact.

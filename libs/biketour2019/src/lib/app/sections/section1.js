      We were six in all—a semi-scientific party. There was Miss J. A. Hastie, a
      woman who has travelled much in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, and who
      is not unacquainted with our Colonies at the Antipodes, or with the
      islands of the South Seas. She was specially interested in the botany of
      the country, in its folklore, and in the people. Then there was Captain W.
      H. Cope; he had been at sea for the greater part of his life, and had in
      the course of his journeyings seen much of the world; he was our nautical
      adviser, and we referred to him in matters connected with the sea. W.
      Glen, Miss Hastie's cousin, was known as the "handy man" of the party. If
      anybody was in difficulties, Glen was always on the spot to lend a helping
      hand. He produced all sorts of things at the right moment. Did any one
      require a screw-driver, then Glen had it; want a corkscrew, Glen could
      supply it; a pair of scissors, he produced them—some string, a strap, it
      was all the same. If a camera struck work, Glen could render the strike
      ineffective, for he carried two, and could lend one without interfering
      with his own photographic work. A. W. Hill, of King's College, Cambridge,
      was our botanist—who describes what he saw. H. H. Thomas, of Balliol, paid
      special attention to the geological formation of the country that we
      traversed, and he was frequently to be seen, camera in hand, taking shots
      at interesting formations—a glaciated lava surface, a volcanic vent, or an
      immense "erratic" boulder or "perched block," for instance; he also
      sketched industriously, and sometimes paced the ground compass in hand in
      order that he might record in his note-book the direction of a line of
      fissure, or the position of hot springs along that line; or something else
      of interest to geologists in particular. I was the geographer, whose
      mission it was to make a map of a small portion of the country traversed,
      to get a general idea of its conformation, and to note valleys and
      mountains, ice-fields and snow slopes, lava flows and hot springs, mighty
      rivers and tiny rivulets.

      Next day rain, fog, and mist prevailed, so there was much whist-playing
      and smoking below, and much blowing of whistle above. Towards evening we
      were off the coast of Iceland; the land was not visible, for we were
      enveloped in fog, but there was no doubt about it, for we could hear that
      land was not far distant. It may seem strange, but it was a fact, we were
      really feeling our way along the coast by the aid of the steam-whistle.
      The land thereabouts rises abruptly from the sea, and the echoes from the
      sheer faces of rock enabled the officers of the vessel to judge their
      distance. We went dangerously near to another vessel in the fog, but soon
      afterwards it cleared off a bit, and there, just abeam on the starboard
      side, was the other vessel, sufficiently close to be a dangerous neighbour
      in thick weather. At midnight we were going full speed ahead, but when I
      awoke at seven in the morning it was to find that our experiences of fog
      were not at an end, that we were again in a very dense one, and that we
      were lying-to. After breakfast it lifted sufficiently to allow of a course
      being shaped for Northfjord, our first port of call in Iceland. Much of
      the scenery of this fjord was obscured by the thick atmosphere, but
      occasional glimpses through rifts proved that we were missing many fine
      scenes that are on view when the conditions are favourable. The first
      sight of Iceland was obtained at Dalatangi Point, four or five miles to
      the north of the entrance to Northfjord. In the fog we had gone too far
      north. Other glimpses on the way were of a corrie near Dalatangi, and the
      face of the mountains near Mjofifjord. Our stay at Northfjord was of but
      short duration, and there was no time to go ashore, so the only view we
      had of the town was obtained from the vessel's deck.

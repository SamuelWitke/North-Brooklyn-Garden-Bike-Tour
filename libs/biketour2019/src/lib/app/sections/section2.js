      Ashore one is first struck with the Faroese themselves: they are a fine
      race, and retain their native politeness and independence of character;
      they are courteous in the extreme to strangers. Most of the men are
      fishermen or sailors, and many, through their consequent contact with
      English-speaking people, can converse in good understandable English. A
      small trade is done in wool, and we met two of the islanders, fine types
      of the race, returning from their day's work; they were quite picturesque
      figures, for, besides being attired in the national costume, they had
      wound round them a quantity of wool, which in these islands is generally
      plucked, not shorn, from the sheep's back. The national costume consists
      of a sort of brewer's cap, having red and blue stripes as a rule, a cloth
      tunic, a waistcoat, and knee breeches split at the knees, but very rarely
      buttoned, rough woollen stockings and skin shoes. The fishermen often
      dispense with tunic and waistcoat, and wear in their place a woollen
      jersey with long sleeves, that has a strong sheepy smell, having a
      particular pattern worked in pale blue and red on a white ground. The
      women I saw wore dresses of white striped cotton stuff, no ordinary head
      covering, but shawls across the shoulders, which were often pulled over
      the head, and wooden clogs on the feet.

        An unexpected turn in our journey led us to many impressive places.

      We were to have made a start at eleven o'clock the next morning, but fate
      was against us. At the appointed hour the members of the party were ready
      and waiting, but guides, ponies, pack and riding saddles, tents,
      provisions, etc., were not ready, and we could not well start unless they
      were. Saddles and gear required many repairs—most of them had been hired,
      and they were not in the best condition. Our manager of affairs was to be
      seen flitting about settling up accounts, giving directions to the men,
      inspecting saddles, bridles, girths, and gear, and generally trying to
      reduce confusion to order. For an hour or more we were amused, but then we
      began to get impatient. Three of us got hold of a saddle and bridle, and
      we tried the paces of a few of the ponies. In that way we put in an hour
      or two that might have proved irksome, for everything was in such a state
      of confusion and unreadiness, and the space in which the men were working
      was so confined, that we could render no effective help. Instead of
      starting at eleven, it was half-past three before we got away—four and a
      half hours late!

      I engaged two young Faroese to row me to the vessel, and on arrival
      enjoined them to await me that they might put me ashore again; when,
      however, I had changed the films and was ready to return, they were
      nowhere to be found—the young beggars had gone off with another fare, and
      had left me to my own devices and to the off chance of a "lift" in another
      boat. I felt much inclined to make a murderous attack upon the Queen's
      English, to say nothing of the young Faroese had they come my way while
      pacing the deck in impotent wrath; but I was obliged to restrain myself,
      for there was no one with whom I could with justice quarrel, so I
      suppressed the rising ire, and went in search of somebody who could speak
      my native language. In the end I found a Faroese with some knowledge of
      English, and arranged for a passage in a cargo-boat then about to return
      to the shore. Soon I was being conveyed from the Ceres at the rapid
      rate—for a very heavily laden cargo-boat, that is—of about a knot an hour.
      However, I reached the shore in due course, just in time to join our party
      at lunch at the hotel, where they were being entertained by a
      fellow-passenger. A merry meal we had, and in the course of it our host
      joined us in criticising the appointments of the table, but, in spite of a
      few makeshifts, they were not at all bad, and the meal itself was
      decidedly good.

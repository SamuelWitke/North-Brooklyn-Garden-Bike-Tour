      I strolled about, camera in hand, and found that many of the women and
      girls were quite anxious to be photographed; at one spot I came upon a
      group of women squatting on the ground; as I approached, several others
      hastened to join the group, at the same time inviting me to photograph
      them, which I did. Shortly afterwards my films came to an end, so I made a
      journey to the Ceres, which was lying at anchor half a mile from the
      shore, in order to reload the camera.

      The formation of the basaltic hills was most striking, the many pyramidal
      shapes impressing us greatly. There were numerous dykes in the mountain
      side, deep ravines scored perpendicularly in the basaltic formation, where
      softer intrusive material had been eroded more rapidly than the rock on
      each side. At the entrance to Kalsofjord (the channel between the islands
      of Kalso on the west and Bordo and Kuno on the east side) there was a very
      strong current flowing against us in a southerly direction; a course was
      therefore steered close in-shore to avoid the full strength of the current
      in mid-stream. Klaksvig lies in a bay in the island of Bordo, and to reach
      it a turn has to be made eastward between the islands of Kuno and Bordo.
      At the entrance to the bay anchor was dropped, and there we remained all
      night. We were close to the southern end of the island of Kuno, where a
      very fine specimen of a pyramidal mountain frowned down upon us from the
      height of nearly 2300 feet—it is a pyramid that might well cause the shade
      of Cheops, if ever passing that way, to hide his diminished head and fade
      into oblivion. We witnessed some very fine cloud-effects in the course of
      the journey to Klaksvig, for the clouds drifting over the high hills often
      streamed away far to leeward of them.

      On one side of this wall there is a cod-liver oil factory, which we
      inspected; it was not quite so smelly as are some factories where shark or
      whale oil is produced—but more of that anon! One of the vats was full of a
      rich brown liquid, which we were informed was unrefined cod-liver oil. The
      oil is exported in that state after being run into casks, many of which
      were strewed on the hillside. A pretty picture was seen near the wharf,
      where several young women were busily engaged washing cod-fish in a bath
      under cover of an open shed.

        I was the geographer, whose mission it was to make a map of a small
        portion of the country traversed.

      During the voyage I often wrote my notes somewhere about midnight, and
      this night, while thus employed in my cabin, my "stable companion" took it
      into his head that I was preventing him from the proper enjoyment of his
      slumbers, and growled out something to that effect; so, to avoid raising
      his wrath, I interrupted the course of the notes and turned in; but it was
      not to sleep, for I had scarcely laid head upon pillow before certain
      sounds from the bunk below made it evident that unconsciously he was going
      to turn the tables upon me, and that, by stertorously enjoying his
      slumbers, he would prevent me from peacefully enjoying mine. After several
      ineffectual attempts to stop the snoring, I at last fled to the saloon,
      far out of range of the noise, and there reposed in peace for the rest of
      the night.

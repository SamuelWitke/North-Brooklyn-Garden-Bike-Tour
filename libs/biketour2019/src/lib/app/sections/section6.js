      On the west side, and near to the north end of the fjord, there are some
      very fine specimens of common basaltic land forms—two grand corries, a
      fine dyke, some sheer faces of rock, and as we passed by the end of the
      land an almost sheer precipice which faced west came into view, while
      standing out at its foot there was a solitary basaltic column. When coming
      up the fjord the steam-whistle was frequently sounded in order that we
      might hear the very fine echoes for which it is noted; the interval is a
      long one, some three or four seconds. At the corries the sound echoed and
      re-echoed until it finally died away in the heights above.

      The Icelanders are very hospitable, and travellers are made welcome. Every
      farmer who can afford it has one or two guest-chambers that are placed at
      the disposal of any one passing through. On arrival at the farm the
      traveller is invited to partake of coffee. When this is served in the best
      room of the house, the farmer and his wife join the new arrivals in a
      light meal, consisting of excellent coffee, and fancy pastry of equally
      excellent quality. Some of the Icelandic women are very good pastry-cooks,
      and the cakes and pastry they produce often equal in quality any that
      could be procured at a first-class London confectioner's.

      There were some pretty scenes on the river Draghalsá, an interesting
      stream having a number of hard and soft dykes cut through by the water
      that descends in a series of waterfalls to a pool, the overflow from which
      runs into the lake close by. Both pool and stream afford sport for
      fishermen, and Miss Hastie and Jón got quite a good basket of trout there.
      I was less fortunate; but as I did not commence until the others had
      finished, I concluded that they had caught all the fish in the stream and
      had left none for me to catch—but I am not a fisherman, so lack of skill
      may have had something to do with the small success met with.

        At once the music of the steam-whistle was resumed, and our ears were
        again tortured by its shrill blasts.

      On emerging from the fjord and putting out to sea, we encountered a slight
      swell from the west, so the vessel rolled a bit; it was really not much,
      but being the first time during the voyage, it was much disliked by those
      who were not proof against mal de mer. The clear atmosphere was soon left
      behind, for we entered another fog bank when only a few miles distant from
      the land. At once the music of the steam-whistle was resumed, and our ears
      were again tortured by its shrill blasts.

      Just below the bridge a very remarkable sight is to be seen. For more than
      half a mile along the right bank of the river a series of cascades and
      waterfalls flow into it. The water issues from beneath the lava of which
      the steep bank is composed, and then flows down its side; it is a very
      striking proof of the great extent of some of the subterranean rivers.
      Just above the bridge there is a very fine fall in the Hvitá, known as
      Barnafoss; though fine, it cannot be compared with Gullfoss in grandeur,
      and the glory of this part of the river is the series of cascades on its
      right bank. The spot is supposed to have been named from the drowning of
      two children near the fall—Barnafoss, the children's waterfall; but the
      minister at Reykholt declared that the tale is not true, and that the name
      is more likely to have been corrupted from Bjarni, which is a man's name.
      It is worthy of note that the birch woods seem to flourish best in the
      decaying lava in the scoriaceous lava-fields; it also seems to do well in
      soil produced from liparite, for it grows high up on the east side of the
      liparite mountain, Tunga.

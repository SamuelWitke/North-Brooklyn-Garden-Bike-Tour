      Miss Hastie might have had an awkward experience at the spring where she
      elected to perform her ablutions, of whose periodical activity she was at
      the time unaware. During breakfast, one of the guides informed us that the
      small geyser Miss Hastie had been using as her hot-water tap had "gone
      off." Subsequent experience proved such pools untrustworthy for washing of
      any kind. A number of handkerchiefs left by themselves to soak were found
      an hour or two later making their way down an escape hole in the basin,
      and one that had been entirely absorbed by suction was not returned during
      a subsequent eruption by the dishonest geyser.

      We erected our tents beside a blue warm-water stream facing the sinter
      terraces, and as the next day was Sunday, we camped there for two nights.
      We all took a number of photographs of the terraces and the hot springs,
      and tried to catch the small geysers when they erupted, as with a few
      exceptions they did at short intervals; it is true that the eruption was
      not very violent, and the water was not thrown to a great height, three
      feet, perhaps, being the maximum.

        I had come to this part of the country intending to make a quick survey
        of it as we traversed it from end to end.

      The next day was devoted to exploring the surrounding neighbourhood, and
      the different members of the party were struck with different features.
      Thomas and I set off together. We made for the higher ground, and looked
      round; we at once saw that we were at the edge of a recent (geologically)
      lava flow. About four miles distant there stuck up two horns, which we
      afterwards discovered to be the only prominent remains of the cone of the
      volcano, Strytur, whence the lava had been ejected. Strytur stands in the
      middle of the long strip of country lying between, and about equidistant
      from, the two great ice-fields, Lang Jökull and Hoff Jökull, the area of
      each of which is roughly about five hundred square miles.{" "}

      The strip is about fourteen miles wide at its narrowest part (not eight as
      shown on the existing maps), and extends north and south about twenty-five
      miles. Strytur is on the divide, or water-parting, between one system of
      rivers flowing north and another flowing south, and it stands on the
      highest part of this strip of land. The lava, as it issued from the
      volcano, flowed north and south down gentle declivities, and spread out
      east and west almost to the outlying ranges on the margins of the
      ice-fields. North it extends to just beyond Dufufell, and south almost to
      Lake Hvitarvatn.
